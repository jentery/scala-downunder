description: "This is a chance for everyone to present an interesting topic. These are strictly limited to 5 mins. You can speak on anything related to scala and/or software development. Due to the limited time frame it's best to focus on a single point that you wish to present. We have heaps of time so if you have a couple of good presentations, come prepared for both."
