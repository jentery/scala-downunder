    <p>Typesafe and Movio brought you the first ever Scala Downunder Conference that was held at Movio HQ on September 5 – 6 2014 in Auckland, NZ.</p>

    <p>This conference brought together the Scala Australasian community with the first day offering a program of keynote presentations, expert guest speakers, and informal networking with fellow developers. The second day was more hands on, with workshops for both beginner and advanced Scala developers, pairing sessions and Scala Days video replays.</p>

    <p>Due to the success of the inaugural event we will return in 2015, so watch this space for updates.</p>

    <p>Scala Downunder is a unique opportunity to share your experiences and new ideas around creating applications with Scala, and related Typesafe technologies.</p>

    <p><strong>Watch Keynote speaker Jonas Bonér, CTO & Co-Founder of Typesafe  - “A 5 year retrospective and the future of distributed computing”.</strong></p>
